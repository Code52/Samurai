## Samurai - A cross-platform game

Some ideas are up on the [wiki](https://github.com/Code52/Samurai/wiki) but the best place to find out what is going on is in our jabbr!

### Getting started

**Getting started with Git and GitHub**

 * [Setting up Git for Windows and connecting to GitHub](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/)
 * [Forking a GitHub repository](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)
 * [The simple guide to GIT](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/)

Once you're familiar with Git and GitHub, clone the repository and run the ```.\build.cmd``` script to compile the code and run all the unit tests. You can use this script to test your changes quickly.

### Discussing ideas 

* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/board/samurai/4f1d3d847a38f6221f1d9354) - add ideas, or claim an idea and start working on it!
* [JabbR Chatroom](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/code52) - discuss things in real-time with people all over the world!

### Other bits and pieces

For the server you'll need:

* [MVC4](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc4) - we're using the latest and greatest!

* [Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/) - for the persisting of current game objects [install notes](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart+Windows)
                                     
* And SQL Express for the User and Stats
 

For the current clients you'll need:

* [Windows Phone 7 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=27570)

* The WP7 SDK will also install the XNA bits compatible for Windows as well.
